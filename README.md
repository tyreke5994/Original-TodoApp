# Original, unaltered todo application
   As part of the 'watch and code' academy I had to solve many challenges. Three of these challenges involved altering the codebase of an existing 'todo' list application.
   In the 'Original-TodoApp' repository I have contained all the original, unaltered files of the todo app. The original app was created by Addy Osmani and his team over at   TodoMVC.
